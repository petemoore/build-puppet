#!/bin/bash

# This is a wrapper script for calling generic worker, such that when the worker
# exits, this script will reboot the machine. Note, in the worker config
# (/etc/generic-worker.config) we set numberOfTasksToRun to 1 so that the worker
# will exit after running a single task. This script is then responsible for
# rebooting the machine.

# First run the generic-worker, passing through any arguments handed to this
# wrapper script...
/usr/local/bin/generic-worker "$@"

# Now reboot the machine immediately (time costs money)
/usr/bin/sudo /sbin/reboot
# Sleep to prevent this script from terminating naturally, and launchd restarting
# it. Instead, the shutdown should cause this script to terminate (so it won't
# really sleep for 2 mins). If shutdown doesn't kick in within 2 mins, it is sane
# for this script to exit, and allow launchd to fire up the worker again.
/bin/sleep 120
